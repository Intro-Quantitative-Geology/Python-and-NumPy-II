# Introduction to Python and NumPy, part II

## Sources
This tutorial is based on a combination of [a MATLAB tutorial from Prof. Todd Ehlers (Uni TÃ¼bingen)](http://www.geo.uni-tuebingen.de/arbeitsgruppen/mineralogie-geodynamik/geologie-geodynamik/ibm-documentation/matlab-tutorial.html) and the [Software Carpentry group's](http://software-carpentry.org/) lessons on [Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/).

## Getting started
1. Since [Anaconda may be installing in the background[(Anaconda.md)], you should open a second Terminal window by clicking on the Dash Home icon at the top left corner of the screen, typing `terminal` into the search box, and clicking on the Terminal icon. Alternatively, you can right click on the existing Terminal icon and select **New Terminal**.
2. I assume you have also already [downloaded and extracted the lesson data](Data.md), so you can navigate to the `Data` directory to start this lesson.

    ```bash
    $ cd ~/Desktop/Lab-2/Data
    ```
**Reminder**: the `$` symbol above represents the command prompt in the Terminal window.
3. Open a new IPython window.

    ```bash
    ipython
    ```

Now we are ready to start.

## `for` loops

## Conditional statements

## Other ways to read files (*Optional*)
